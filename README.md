Please "level up" your implementation through the following.
This is a "guide" to a path you can take to adding more and more features.

- **Level 0 (10%):**
	Compilation and creation of a linked list.
- **Level 1 (10%):**
	Addition of an item, and the corresponding length being calculated.
- **Level 2 (10%):**
	Simple contains with a single item list.
- **Level 3 (10%):**
	Ensuring destroy does not destroy a list with items in it.
- **Level 4 (15%):**
	Add multiple items.
- **Level 5-7 (5% each):**
	...and ensure contain works within them with items of various types.
- **Level 8 (15%):**
	Add and remove to properly retrieve items.
- **Level 9 (15%):**
	Properly add, remove, and destroy a list.

Don't forget to properly test your submission, both including all edge cases in the code, and ensuring the you properly pushed all code onto github.
